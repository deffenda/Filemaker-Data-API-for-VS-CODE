# FileMaker Data API Tools — User Guide

## What You Need Before Starting

- **FileMaker Server** with the Data API enabled (Server Admin Console > Connectors > FileMaker Data API)
- A **FileMaker account** with the `fmrest` extended privilege enabled
- Your server must be reachable via **HTTPS** from your machine
- **VS Code** installed

## Installing the Extension

1. Download `filemaker-data-api-tools-1.0.0.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/deffenda/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/releases).
2. Open VS Code.
3. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette.
4. Type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** and select it.
5. Browse to the downloaded `.vsix` file and select it.
6. Click **Reload** when prompted.

After reload, you should see a **FileMaker Explorer** panel in the sidebar (left side, look for the database icon).

## Setting Up a Connection

The extension uses a guided setup that walks you through each field one at a time in the Command Palette bar at the top of VS Code.

### Direct Mode (Connect to FileMaker Server Directly)

Use this when your machine can reach the FileMaker Server directly over HTTPS.

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Type **FileMaker: Add Connection Profile** and select it.
3. You'll be prompted for each field in sequence:

| Step | Prompt | What to Enter | Example |
|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Profile name | A friendly name for this connection | `Production Server` |
| 2 | Authentication Mode | Select **Direct** | — |
| 3 | Server URL | Your FileMaker Server's HTTPS address | `https://fm.yourcompany.com` |
| 4 | Database name | The hosted database file name | `Contacts` |
| 5 | API base path | Leave the default | `/fmi/data` |
| 6 | API version path | Leave the default | `vLatest` |
| 7 | Username | Your FileMaker account username | `api_user` |
| 8 | Password | Your FileMaker account password (hidden as you type) | — |

Your password is stored securely in VS Code's built-in secret storage (platform-level encryption). It is never written to settings files or logs.

4. After completing the prompts, you'll see a confirmation message: *"Added connection profile..."*

### Proxy Mode (Connect Through a Middleware Proxy)

Use this when your team has a proxy/middleware layer in front of FileMaker, or when you can't connect to FileMaker Server directly.

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Type **FileMaker: Add Connection Profile** and select it.
3. You'll be prompted for each field:

| Step | Prompt | What to Enter | Example |
|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Profile name | A friendly name | `Team Proxy` |
| 2 | Authentication Mode | Select **Proxy** | — |
| 3 | Server URL | The FileMaker Server URL your proxy connects to | `https://fm.yourcompany.com` |
| 4 | Database name | The hosted database | `Contacts` |
| 5 | API base path | Leave the default | `/fmi/data` |
| 6 | API version path | Leave the default | `vLatest` |
| 7 | Proxy endpoint | Your proxy's URL | `https://api.yourcompany.com/fm` |
| 8 | API key | Optional API key for your proxy (sent as Bearer token) | — |

## Multiple Profiles

You can create multiple connection profiles (e.g., Dev, Staging, Production):

- Switch between them with **FileMaker: Connect**.
- Only one profile is active at a time.
- Use **Environment Sets** to group profiles and compare layouts across servers.

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

All commands are available from the Command Palette. Type `FileMaker` to see the full list. There are no default keyboard shortcuts — you can bind any command to a shortcut in VS Code's keyboard settings.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| "Connection refused" or timeout | Verify the server URL is correct and reachable. Check your firewall/VPN. |
| HTTP 401 | Reconnect and re-enter your password. Verify the account has `fmrest` privilege. |
| HTTP 403 | Check that the account has access to the specific layouts and scripts. |
| HTTP 404 on metadata | Some servers don't expose metadata endpoints. Use the manual field entry flow. |
| Layouts not showing | Click refresh in the Explorer, or run **FileMaker: Refresh Schema Cache**. |
| Features disabled | You may be in an untrusted workspace. Trust the workspace via VS Code's trust dialog. |
| Extension not visible | Check that the VSIX installed correctly. Look for "FileMaker Data API Tools" in the Extensions panel. |
